# Welcome to Tendy

The goal of this project is to have all local rink ice times available in the dmv area become easily accessible and updated automatically for stick and shoots. 

**This site is solo developed and currently a work in progress.** Feel free to contact me at any time below. 

The site is currently being made at [https://eloisedev.github.io/tendy/](https://eloisedev.github.io/tendy/) 

## What it does

This site pulls from local rinks event schedules to allow all event information to be easily displayed in one interface, making finding ice time much easier. 

Currently being pulled from:  
Medstar capitals Iceplex  
Skatequest (TBA)  
Prince William Ice center (TBA)  
Ashburn Ice house (TBA)  
Tucker road Ice rink (TBA)
